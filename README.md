# Bootstrapping-Test-for-Time-Series-Data_Handwashing
This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

I am going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing by statistically testing significance. The dataset is time series data, so I will divide the timline into two periods, one before the handwashing policy executed, the other after it.
